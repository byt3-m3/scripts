# CGI upload
This is my CGI upload Perl script. It handles an HTTP file upload and stores
the file on the server. Itâ€™s not very complex. The only notable features are
the calculation of the hash algorithms MD5 and SHA256 and a directory structure
for the stored files. Read the source if you need more information^^
